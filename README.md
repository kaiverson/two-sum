# Two Sum Problem from LeetCode

This repository contains a Python solution for the "Two Sum" problem from LeetCode.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to* `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same element twice*.

You can return the answer in any order.



**Example:**

**Input:** nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

**Output:** [0, 1]

**Explanation:** nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, so the answer is [0, 1].

## File Structure
- `solution.py`: Contains the Python implementation fo the `twoSum` method withing the `Solution` class.
- `test_two_sum.py`: Includes unit tests using `unittest` to validate the correctness of the `twoSum` method.

# Usage

To test the solution, run `test_two_sum.py`. Ensure Python is installed on your system.

```bash
python test_two_sum.py
